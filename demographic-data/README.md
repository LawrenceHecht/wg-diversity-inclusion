# Category: Diversity and Inclusion

## Definitions
Some of the language we use, and what we mean.

* **Diversity**: How different are the people present?
* **Inclusion**: How well do we enable these different people to work together?
* **Retention**: How long do different people stay engaged?
* **Attraction**: How well do we extend a hand to different newcomers?

*Example 1:* Two people in a room. They can be diverse, but they don’t have to work together or stay there until tomorrow. AND just because someone is there, doesn’t mean their experience is great.

*Example 2:* Some minorities are not necessarily visible, do we want to measure their degree of visibility/outness? (e.g., disability, socio-economic, LGBTIQ, religion)

*Example 3:* There may be women within a community that is less inclusive, but the women are determined to “see it through” and participate. In this case, retention does not necessarily reflect the level of inclusion within a community.

## Dimensions of Demographics
NOTE: that *how* we might ask these questions, and what potential answers might be are currently out of scope.  

*NOTE:* that regional appropriateness of demographics is also currently out of scope, and will be its own task.

*NOTE:* that the legal, privacy and ethical issues related to asking for, storing and visualizing data is currently out of scope, and will be its own task.

*NOTE:* The [Open Demographics Initiative](http://nikkistevens.com/open-demographics/index.html) defined standard ways to ask for demographic information. CHAOSS builds on this work and does not want to duplicate that effort.

1. Gender Identity
2. Sexual orientation
3. Romatic orientation
4. Age
5. Location/Region/Country
6. Socioeconomic status
7. Tenure (time with project) / Tenure with the ecosystem
8. Race/Ethnicity
9. Religion 
10. First Language
11. Confidence with English
12. Dis/Ability
13. Caregiver (child or eldercare)
14. Identifies as underrepresented (which can include components of above, or be separate)
15. Paid contributor vs. unpaid volunteer contributor

*NOTE:* that paid vs. unpaid contributors can be problematic and nuanced from the perspective of diversity and inclusion. Many people who participate as volunteers are coming at it from a position of privilege because they can afford to spend their free time participating in an open source project instead of working a second job to make ends meet, caring for family members, or spending time meeting basic survival needs. In other words, having more volunteer contributors might actually mean that the project is less diverse, rather than more diverse. However, in a corporate sponsored project, involving volunteer contributors could be a sign that the community is welcoming and inclusive.

## Metrics Focus Areas

The following are the areas of analysis:

| Focus Area | Goal |
| --- | --- |
|[Communication Inclusivity](../focus-areas/communication/) | Identify how we are communicating with contributors, and potential contributors.|
|[Contributor Community Diversity](../focus-areas/contribution/) | Identify the diversity of the contributions within a community, and howe those different contributions are valued.|
|[Event Diversity](../focus-areas/events/) | Identify the diversity and inclusion at events. |
|[Governance](../focus-areas/governance/) | Identify how diverse and inclusive our governance is.|
|[Leadership](../focus-areas/leadership/) | Identify how healthy our community leadership is.|
|[Project and Community](../focus-areas/project-and-community/) | Identify how diverse and inclusive our project places, where community engagement occurs, are.|
|[Recognition of Good Work](../focus-areas/recognition/) | Identify how we recognize/reward good work in our community.|
